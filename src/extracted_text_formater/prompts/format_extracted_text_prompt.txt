# Goal:  
Extract structured patient information from the provided extracted text of a medical report.

Format the output strictly as a single-line JSON object with these exact keys:  
- `"patient_name"` (string, required) — the name of the patient as clearly mentioned.  
- `"diagnosis"` (string, required) — the primary medical diagnosis, standardized for medical accuracy and web search.  
- `"symptoms"` (list of strings, required) — a list of the patient's main reported symptoms.  
- `"treatment_plan"` (string, required) — a brief description of the prescribed treatment or plan.

# Rules:  
- Extract exactly and only the patient name, diagnosis, symptoms, and treatment plan from the text.  
- If a field is not mentioned explicitly, use:
  - For `"patient_name"`: `"Unknown"`
  - For `"diagnosis"`: `"Unknown"`
  - For `"symptoms"`: an empty list `[]`
  - For `"treatment_plan"`: `"Unknown"`
- For `"symptoms"`, list individual symptoms as short strings; do not combine them into one long sentence.
- Do not invent or assume information based on context unless clearly stated.
- Always make the disease/diagnosis medically precise and suitable for search engines (e.g., "Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus", not just "diabetes").
- Your JSON must have no extra spaces, no line breaks, and no commentary.
- Always output exactly one JSON object in a single line starting with {{ and ending with }}.

# Output Format:  
- Only output a valid JSON object, nothing else.  
- Do not wrap the JSON with triple backticks (```json) or single backticks (`).  
- Example of correct output:
{{"patient_name":"Ahmed B.","diagnosis":"Type 2 Diabetes","symptoms":["fatigue","excessive thirst","frequent urination"],"treatment_plan":"Metformin 500mg twice daily; follow low-sugar diet."}}
