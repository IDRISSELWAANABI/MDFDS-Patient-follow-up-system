# Goal:  
Extract the main disease information from the provided raw text medical report.  
Format the output as a strict JSON object with the following keys:  
- `"disease"` (string, required) â€” includes the disease name, type, and any important medical classification information that would help a web search.  

# Rules:  
- Focus only on identifying the main disease mentioned in the report.  
- Include disease type if available (e.g., "Type 2 Diabetes", "Stage 3 Lung Cancer").  
- If multiple diseases are mentioned, choose the most critical one based on severity or prominence.  
- If no disease is found, output `"disease": "Unknown"`.  
- Do not include symptoms, treatments, or unrelated information.  
- Keep the `"disease"` field as detailed and medically accurate as possible to improve search results.  

# Output Format:  
Always respond with ONLY a valid JSON object and nothing else.  
DO NOT wrap the JSON with triple backticks (` ```json ` or ` ``` `) or single backticks (`).  
The output must begin and end with curly braces `{{}}`.  

# Your Task:
