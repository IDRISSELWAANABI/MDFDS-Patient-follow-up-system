# Goal:  
Extract the main disease information from the provided raw medical report text.  
Format the output strictly as a single-line JSON object with these exact keys:  
- `"disease"` (string, required) â€” must include the disease name, type, and any important medical classification information helpful for web searches.  

# Rules:  
- Focus exclusively on identifying the main disease mentioned in the report.  
- Include disease type and classification details if available (e.g., "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus", "Stage 3B Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer").  
- If multiple diseases are mentioned, select the most critical one based on severity or prominence.  
- If no disease is clearly mentioned, output: `"disease": "Unknown"`.  
- Exclude symptoms, treatments, causes, prognoses, or unrelated information.  
- Standardize disease names to be medically accurate and suitable for search engines.  
- Always output exactly one JSON object on a single line, with no extra spaces, no line breaks, and no commentary.

# Output Format:  
- Only output a valid JSON object, nothing else.  
- Do not wrap the JSON with triple backticks (```json) or single backticks (`).  
- The output must start with {{ and end with }}.  
- Example of correct output:
{{"disease":"Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"}}
